# OpenAI API Integration Planning

## Overview

This feature will standardize and enhance all LLM calls within the application to use the OpenAI API through a centralized configuration, ensuring consistent error handling, authentication, and performance monitoring.

## Background

Currently, the application has LLM functionality implemented in at least two API routes:
- `/api/analyze-feature/route.ts` - Uses OpenAI to generate a form schema for feature planning
- `/api/generate-plan/route.ts` - Uses OpenAI to generate planning documents

The application is already using the Vercel AI SDK (`ai`) and OpenAI integration (`@ai-sdk/openai`), but needs standardization across the codebase and proper environment variable management.

## Goals

1. Create a centralized OpenAI client configuration
2. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms 
3. Enable model configuration through environment variables
4. Add logging and monitoring for API usage
5. Implement token usage tracking
6. Create helper utilities for common LLM operations

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **OpenAI Client Factory**
   - Creates and configures OpenAI API clients
   - Loads API keys from environment variables
   - Manages model selection based on configuration

2. **LLM Response Handler**
   - Common error handling
   - Standardized success responses
   - Token usage tracking

3. **Model Configuration**
   - Environment-based model selection (development vs. production)
   - Model fallback mechanisms 

4. **Utilities**
   - Prompt templating
   - Context window management
   - Response parsing helpers

## Implementation Constraints

1. The existing `.env` file contains an OpenAI API key that should be used
2. Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API routes
3. Should support both completion and chat-based models
4. Need to handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully
5. Should implement a fallback to mock data when API is unavailable

## Tech Stack

The implementation will use:

- Next.js 15 - For API routes and server components
- Vercel AI SDK - For streamlined AI implementation
- OpenAI Node.js SDK - For direct API access when needed
- Environment variables - For configuration management
- TypeScript - For type safety

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for the OpenAI client factory
2. Integration tests for API routes
3. Mocking of OpenAI API responses for testing
4. Error scenario testing (API down, rate limiting, etc.)

## Security Considerations

1. API keys must never be exposed to the client side
2. Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
3. Consider implementing user quotas to prevent abuse
4. Content filtering for user-generated prompts

## Monitoring & Analytics

1. Log all API calls (excluding sensitive data)
2. Track token usage for cost optimization
3. Monitor error rates and performance
4. Set up alerts for unusual activity

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)
2. Implementation of a caching layer to reduce API costs
3. Streaming responses for chat-like interfaces
4. Fine-tuning capability for custom models
