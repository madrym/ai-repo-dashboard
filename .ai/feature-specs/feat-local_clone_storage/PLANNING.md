# 📝 Local Repository Storage (Clone and Store)

## 📋 Overview
This feature enables cloning GitHub repositories and storing them locally in a structured way. The system will organize repositories by organization, repo name, and branch, maintaining both the raw content and generated summaries.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
.local-storage/
  └── <org>/
      └── <repo>/
          └── <branch>/
              ├── content/        # Cloned repository content
              └── repomix-summary.xml  # Repository summary
```

### Components

1. **Repository Cloning Service**
   - Responsible for cloning repositories from GitHub
   - Handles authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
   - Creates the required directory structure

2. **Repomix Integration**
   - Processes cloned repositories with repomix
   - Generates compressed XML summaries
   - Stores summaries alongside content

3. **Local Storage Manager**
   - Manages the local storage structure
   - Provides APIs for accessing stored repositories
   - Handles cache invalidation and updates

4. **Frontend Integration**
   - UI components to manage repository cloning
   - Displays repository data and summaries
   - Provides navigation through stored repositories

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Git Integration**: NodeJS-based git operations for cloning
- **File System Operations**: Node.js fs module for directory manipulation
- **Repomix**: CLI integration for generating repository summaries

### APIs and Interfaces
1. **Repository Management API**
   - `cloneRepository(org, repo, branch)`: Clone a repository
   - `getRepositorySummary(org, repo, branch)`: Get repository summary
   - `listStoredRepositories()`: List all stored repositories

2. **Storage Interface**
   - Methods to access and manipulate the local repository storage
   - Consistent path resolution across the application

## 🔒 Constraints & Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Efficient handling of large repositories
   - Optimized storage to prevent excessive disk usage
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

2. **Security**
   - Secure handling of GitHub credentials
   - Validation of repository sources
   - Potential sanitization of cloned content

3. **User Experience**
   - Clear feedback during cloning process
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Error handling with actionable messages

4. **Future Extensibility**
   - Design with S3 migration in mind
   - Abstract storage interface for multiple backends
   - Version tracking for repository updates

## 📈 Implementation Approach
1. Start with a minimal viable implementation focused on local storage
2. Implement core cloning functionality first
3. Add repomix integration once basic cloning works
4. Build UI components to interact with the local storage
5. Add advanced features like caching and updates
