# GitHub Repository API Authentication

## Goals
- Implement secure authentication with GitHub repositories using the GitHub API key
- Create a reusable GitHub API client service
- Ensure proper error handling and rate limit management
- Support repository data fetching and analysis

## Background
The application currently has a GitHub API key in the environment variables but lacks a proper implementation to authenticate and interact with GitHub repositories. Users need to connect their repositories to analyze and plan features.

## Purpose
This feature will enable secure and reliable GitHub repository access, allowing users to connect their repositories for analysis and planning purposes. It will establish a foundation for all GitHub-related functionality in the application.

## Target Audience
- Developers looking to analyze their repositories
- Team leads planning features for their projects
- Project managers tracking development progress

## Technical Architecture
- Create a modular GitHub API client service
- Implement repository-specific API endpoints
- Add authentication state management
- Develop UI components for repository connection and selection

### GitHub API Client Architecture:
```
lib/
  github/
    index.ts         - Main entry point for GitHub API functionality
    client.ts        - Core API client implementation
    config.ts        - Configuration and environment variable handling
    types.ts         - TypeScript interfaces and types
    repositories.ts  - Repository-specific API functions
    utils.ts         - Utility functions
```

## Technical Considerations
- GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests per hour for authenticated requests)
- Error handling for network issues and API failures
- Caching strategies to minimize API calls
- Security considerations for handling API tokens
- Pagination for repository data fetching

## Dependencies
- GitHub API v3 (REST API)
- Environment variables for GitHub API authentication
- Next.js server actions for secure API calls
- React for UI components
- Type-safe API response handling

## Security Considerations
- The GitHub API key must be kept secure on the server side
- No client-side exposure of the API key
- Token validation before making API requests
- Secure storage of user access tokens if implementing OAuth
- Consider implementing temporary tokens for client-side operations

## Performance Considerations
- Implement response caching to reduce API calls
- Optimize data fetching with pagination and selective fields
- Consider using GitHub's GraphQL API for complex data requirements
- Implement background refresh for repository data
