# GitHub Repository API Authentication Tasks

## Phase 1: Core GitHub API Client Implementation
- [x] Create directory structure for GitHub API client (`lib/github/`)
- [x] Implement config.ts to securely access GitHub API environment variables
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for API responses
- [x] Implement core API client with error handling and rate limit management
- [x] Write utility functions for API requests and response handling
- [x] Create repository-specific API functions
- [x] Implement caching mechanism for API responses

## Phase 2: Repository Connection Implementation
- [x] Update auth/page.tsx to use the real GitHub API client
- [x] Implement repository URL parsing and validation
- [x] Create repository connection endpoint in API routes
- [x] Add repository metadata fetching (branches, contributors, etc.)
- [x] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [x] Add repository connection state management

## Phase 3: Dashboard Integration
- [x] Update dashboard to display real repository data
- [x] Implement repository selector for multiple repositories
- [x] Create repository information components
- [ ] Add repository statistics and insights
- [ ] Implement repository file explorer with real data

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for GitHub API client functions
- [ ] Create mock GitHub API responses for testing
- [ ] Test authentication flows and error scenarios
- [ ] Document API client usage and examples
- [ ] Create sample repositories for testing
- [ ] Update README with GitHub API implementation details

## Discovered During Work
- The dashboard needs component updates to fix type errors with the repository information display
- Repository file structure and content fetching APIs would be needed for full file explorer functionality

## Completed Tasks
- Created GitHub API client with proper authentication
- Implemented repository data fetching and caching
- Created repository connection UI and API endpoints
- Added repository information display component
- Created repository state management context

## Notes & Considerations
- Ensure all API calls are server-side to protect the API key
- Consider implementing GitHub App authentication as an alternative approach
- Add pagination support for repositories with large amounts of data
- Consider rate limiting monitoring and alerts
